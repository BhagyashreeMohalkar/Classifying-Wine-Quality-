# 🍷 Classifying Wine Quality 🍇

A machine learning project that classifies wines into different quality categories based on their **physicochemical properties**. Using real-world data, this project aims to predict the quality of wine based on factors like acidity, sugar content, and pH level. 🍷🔬  
With the help of classification models, the goal is to assist winemakers and consumers in selecting wines with the best characteristics! 🌟

## 🌟 Features  
✅ **Wine Quality Classification**: Classifies wines into quality categories based on their physicochemical properties.  
⚙️ **Feature-Rich Dataset**: Uses attributes like **alcohol content**, **sulphates**, **volatile acidity**, and more.  
📊 **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the relationship between features and wine quality.  
🔍 **Predictive Model**: Trains classification models to predict the quality of wines with accuracy.

## 🧩 Components Used  
- 🍇 **Wine Quality Dataset** (e.g., the Wine Quality dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)  
- 📚 **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- 📈 **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization  
- 🧑‍💻 **Scikit-learn** for training and evaluating machine learning models

## 💡 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Dataset Loading**: The dataset containing wine attributes is loaded into the system.  
2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**: Missing values are handled, and features are normalized or scaled as required.  
3️⃣ **Model Training**: Various classification models like , **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest** are trained on the data.  
4️⃣ **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on their **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.  
5️⃣ **Prediction**: The trained models are used to predict the quality of new wine samples based on their physicochemical properties.
